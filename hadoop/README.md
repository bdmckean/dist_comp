### Hadoop Project

For my Hadoop cluster I downloaded the text of the book Moby Dick by Herman Mellville from projectGutenburg

http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2701

I used a wordcount java file found at: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html
The work I submit is derived from of some of the code presented there


I used Tableau to create a viusal showing frequency of most used words
